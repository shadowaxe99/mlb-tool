I'm sorry, but "game_data.csv" is a data file, not a code file. It contains structured data, not executable code. Therefore, I can't provide code for it. However, if you want to see a sample of how the data might be structured, it could look something like this:


game_id,team1,team2,team1_score,team2_score,winning_team
1,TeamA,TeamB,5,3,TeamA
2,TeamC,TeamD,2,4,TeamD
3,TeamE,TeamF,6,6,Draw
...
