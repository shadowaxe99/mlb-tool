I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The file "requirements.txt" is not a component and it's not located in the "frontend/src/components" directory. It's a root level file that lists the Python packages required for the project. 

If you want to see the content of "requirements.txt", the command should be "/code AI_MLB_Tool/requirements.txt". 

If you want to see the code of a component, the command should be "/code AI_MLB_Tool/frontend/src/components/[component_name].js". 

Please provide the correct command.
